# CODSOFT TASK 3 — Iris Flower Classification with Python

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of the CodSoft Internship Program and focuses on building a classification model to predict the species of Iris flowers based on petal and sepal measurements. The Iris dataset is a classical dataset used for introducing machine learning classification problems.

The goal is to explore the dataset, visualize patterns, and build a model that accurately classifies each flower into one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica.

## 🎯 Objective
To develop a supervised machine learning classification model using Python that can identify Iris species based on sepal and petal dimensions.

## 📊 Dataset
Source: UCI / Kaggle - Iris Dataset

**Features Used**:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

**Target**:
- Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  
- Google Colab

## 🚀 Methodology
- Load and explore the dataset  
- Perform data cleaning and analysis  
- Visualize feature distributions and correlations  
- Encode target labels using LabelEncoder  
- Train a Logistic Regression classification model  
- Evaluate performance using Accuracy and Confusion Matrix  
- Generate advanced visualizations: box plots, violin plots, heatmaps, density plots

## 📈 Results
The classification model achieved high accuracy and effectively differentiated the species based on input features. Detailed analytics were performed to better understand feature patterns and relationships.
