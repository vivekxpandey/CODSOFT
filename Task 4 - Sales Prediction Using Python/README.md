# CODSOFT TASK 4 — Sales Prediction Using Python

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of the CodSoft Internship Program and involves building a regression model to predict product sales based on advertising budgets. The dataset includes spending across different media platforms like TV, Radio, and Newspaper.

The goal is to forecast future sales using machine learning, allowing businesses to optimize their marketing investments.

## 🎯 Objective
To develop a supervised regression model that predicts product sales based on advertising channel expenditures.

## 📊 Dataset
Source: Advertising Dataset - Kaggle

**Features Used**:
- TV Advertising Spend  
- Radio Advertising Spend  
- Newspaper Advertising Spend  

**Target**:
- Sales (units sold)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  
- Google Colab

## 🚀 Methodology
- Load and clean the dataset  
- Analyze distribution and correlation of ad spend vs. sales  
- Visualize key trends with scatter plots and heatmaps  
- Train a Linear Regression model  
- Evaluate model with R² score and Mean Absolute Error  
- Perform forecasting and residual analysis  
- Add multiple visual insights into channel performance and spend trends

## 📈 Results
The model effectively predicted sales based on advertising inputs. Visual analytics helped identify which advertising channels had stronger relationships with sales, supporting strategic marketing decisions.
